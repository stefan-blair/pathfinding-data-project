					<h3>Interaction</h3>
					<p>
						Using the display to the left, click on various BLUE tiles to find the path from the top left corner to that tile.  You can toggle between the Astar and Dijkstra algorithms, generate a new map, and change the complexity of that map.  The simplest map is a simple city map, and the most complex is a simulated countryside.

							<h3>Introduction</h3>
							<p>
								The purpose of this project was to test the efficiency of two pathfinding algorithms, Astar and Dijkstra's algorithm.  Astar is derived from Dijkstra's algorithm, but with an added heurstic value.  Dijkstra's algorithm, given a start and end point, scans areas adjacent to the start point, and continues in all directions until the end point is found (its far more complex then this, but just to give a brief overview).  Astar does the same, but instead of expanding in all directions, it leans towards the endpoint by finding the Manhattan distance to the endpoint, and modifying the direction it scans based on this distance.  I wrote an algorithm to generate randomized maps based on a given seed, and then tested the two algorithms to see which could find a shorter path.  The Astar algorithm always found the path in less time, but there were occations when this path was not the most efficient. 
							</p>
							<h3>Hypothesis</h3>
							<p>My hypothesis is that the Dijkstra's algorithm will be outperformed on maps that more resemble a grid, however as the complexity increases, it will begin to outperform the AStar algorithm.
							</p>
							<h3>Algorithms</h3>
							<h5>AStar</h5>
							<p>The AStar algorithm, in a nutshell, works by taking a map, and keeping two lists.  Starting from the beginning point, all immediate tiles are added to the open list, and based off of which is closer to the beginning and the end, the immediate tiles of that tile are then add, and that tile is added to the closed list.  The way that the tile that is closest to each point is found is by calculating the total distance traveled to that point, and then finding the distance WITHOUT diagnals and obsticals to the endpoint.  The addition of these two distances is known as the F Score.  Finally, after the end point is added to the open list, the algorithm retraces its steps back to the beginning.
							</p>
							<h5>Dijkstra</h5>
							<p>Dijkstra's algorithm is almost exactly the same as AStar, besides one very important difference.  When AStar finds the point to add to the closed list, it does not take into account which tile is closer to the end point.  It in essense spreads out evenly in all directions until the path is found.  While this can make it much slower, it can also make its path more efficient.
							</p>
							<h5>Map Generation</h5>
							<p>The randomized maps are generated using an algorithm I developed, which, given a random seed, will go through the map and draw various paths.  With a random seed of 0, it will immitate a grid style city map, and as the seed increases, it will add more variation, making it resemble a countryside or an older city without a grid.
							</p>
							<h3>Findings</h3>
							<p>The following images are heat maps of the generated maps starting at a random seed of 0, and gradually increasing to 10.  The yellow color means that the algorithms were tied (in which case the AStar algorithm wins, as it takes less cycles to complete), and the red indicates that the path generated by Djikstra's algorithm won, as its path was shortest.

							<p>These maps indicate that, in fact, the AStar algorithm outperforms Dijkstra's algorithm at a lower complexity map, however as the complexity increases, Dijkstra begins to find more effient paths.<br>
							Below is another visualization, a scatterplot graph showing all of the points sorted by complexity and the amount of distance covered.  The X Axis is the seed and the Y Axis shows the absolute difference between the distance generated using AStar and the difference using Dijkstra.  As the seed increases, Dijkstra increasingly outperforms AStar.

							<h3>Conclusion</h3>
							<p>In conclusion, the AStar algorithm is most efficient in grid/city maps, and Djikstra is more efficient in more complex maps.
